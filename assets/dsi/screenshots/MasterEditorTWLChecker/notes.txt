I'm not sure the of the proper aspect ratio here, but i left some room for cropping.
CARD.SRL looks to just be Card ROM Header Checker, that's what Unlaunch says at least.
NAND.SRL is also the same
ORG.SRL doesn't actually work, in order of appearance the messages are
"セーブデー夕がこわれています
セーブデー夕をつくりなおします"
translated:
"Save data is corrupted
Recreate your save data"

"初期化中です。
電源を切らないでください。"
translated:
"Initializing.
Do not turn off."

"初期化が終ろしました。"
translated:
"Initialization finished."
but then the app doesn't do anything, you can't interact with any buttons lol
